Hi! 👋🏼 I'm Brandon, a Software Engineer based in Vancouver, Canada.

With over 5 years of experience in software development, I love solving complex problems and building seamless experiences. 

I've worked with multiple cross-functional design and development teams across startups and non-profits in Canada.

Most recently I was a Senior Software Engineer at JUDI.AI helping to enable community-based financial institutions to provide a fintech-like experience for small business in Canada and the US. I built and maintained services to leverage their proprietary categorization engine and risk detection logic which led to 10 million+ banking transactions analyzed and in excess of $1 billion worth of small business loan applications evaluated.

I've also worked at Telexy Healthcare, East-Side Games, and have done contract work for Simon Fraser University and University of Saskatchewan. I've done work for clients such as Vancity, Credit Union of Colorado and Seattle Bank. I'm also a volunteer technology resource for BC Rent Bank!

Some fun + impactful projects I've worked on include: 
- 🏃🏻‍♀️ Integrated an internal API into an externally exposed .NET service to categorize transactions
and make credit decisions
- 📁 Owning the design and development of a NodeJS microservice and accompanying React UI integration to enable financial account managers to securely share files leveraging Docker, Azure Blob Storage, Azure API Management, Terraform, and Auth0
- 📝 Developing of a NodeJS REST API that processes credit application data into a human readable extract in HTML, CSV, PDF, JSON, and TXT formats
- 🔁 Coordinated with Customer Success to establish an Azure SQL Database rollback routine and managed its use in a failed deployment of two tier 1 services
- 🏃🏻‍♀️ Led the release of a major 7 month full-stack refactoring so that the credit products offered by our partners through our platform could be customized.
